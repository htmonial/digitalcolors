A space for color sharing across time and space.

I just updated it with timestamp metadata for each color - would also be interesting to collect geodata. Would also like to do so that the metadata + color codes appear as text when the hover floats across a color field on the page.

And can think of so many interesting ways to reorganize the colors on the page. You probably can too.

Should there be a feature where you can choose colors added in a specific time frame or from different regions across the world?

Should the visitor be able to scale the page to make the fields bigger / smaller?

The project is also in need of a host, domain & serverwise.

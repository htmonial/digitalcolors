A space for color sharing across time and space.

I would like to add metadata like timestamps and possibly locations. Would also like to do so that this metadata + color codes appears as text when the hover floats across a color field on the page.

And can think of so many interesting ways to reorganize the colors on the page.

Should there be a feature where you can choose colors added in a specific time frame or from different regions across the world?

Should the visitor be able to scale the page to make the fields bigger / smaller?
